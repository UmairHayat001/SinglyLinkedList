# SinglyLinkedList
Linked List is data structure which is helpful in many situations where arrays can not help us completely.
A singly linked list is a type of linked list where each node contains data and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence. This structure forms a chain of nodes connected in one direction, typically starting with a head node and ending with a node whose next pointer is null, indicating the end of the list.
Structure of a Singly Linked List
Each node in a singly linked list consists of two parts:
1.	Data: The actual value or information contained within the node.
2.	Next Pointer: A reference to the next node in the list. In the last node, this pointer is set to null to signify the end.
